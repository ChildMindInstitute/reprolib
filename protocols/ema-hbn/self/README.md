# Healthy Brain Network: Daily Assessments


As part of the Healthy Brain Network study, we want to collect daily information on your physical and mental health.
You will be asked a short set of questions twice a day. We will record the information and share it with you and our researchers so we can look for patterns in the data. These patterns may help you and your clinicians provide better care for yourself.

## ☀️ Questions we'll ask in the morning

Every morning, we'd like to know:

* 🛌 how many hours you were in bed (including bedtime and what time you woke up).
* 😴 whether or not you had nightmares or night terrors
* 💊 if you took any sleep aids.

Answer these questions to the best of your ability. It is ok if you don't know the answer to some of these questions!

## 🌙 Questions we'll ask in the evening

At the end of the day, we'll ask some questions about your:

* 😰 stress level
* ⚡️  energy level
* 🏥 overall health

As before, answer these questions to the best of your ability. It is ok if you don't know the answer to some of these questions!

Thank you for participating in this study!
