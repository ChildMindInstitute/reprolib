In this experiment you will see five arrows on the screen. For instance, you might see:

![congruent-left](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReproNim/schema-standardization/master/activities/FlankerExample/items/congruent-left.png)

or

![incongruent-right](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReproNim/schema-standardization/master/activities/FlankerExample/items/incongruent-right.png)

Your task is to respond by pressing the button corresponding to the ***middle*** arrow. So if you see 

![incongruent-left](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReproNim/schema-standardization/master/activities/FlankerExample/items/incongruent-left.png)

you would press the

![left](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReproNim/schema-standardization/master/activities/FlankerExample/items/arrow-left-instructions.png)

button.

After each response you will get feedback about whether you were correct or not. We will start with a short practice set.
